# _Leveraging Support Vector Machines and Large Language Models for Smishing Detection: Towards A More Secure Messaging Environment_

## Introduction

### Background of the Study
With the widespread use of mobile devices and messaging applications, smishing has become an increasingly prevalent cyberthreat. Smishing is a type of phishing attack conducted through SMS to lure users into providing sensitive information by redirecting them to fake websites. The Philippines has emerged as a prime smishing target - it is the most text-messaged country globally according to Kaspersky, and smishing campaigns have spiked markedly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group saw smishing cases double from 2020 up to present, likely due to heightened financial vulnerability in the population. This escalating smishing crisis highlights the need for urgent attention despite recent SIM Card legislation. Conducting further research on local smishing attacks, attacker tactics, and user vulnerabilities could provide data-driven insights to help telecom providers, law enforcement, and user education initiatives combat this issue more effectively as it continues intensifying in the post-pandemic landscape.

To address this issue, this study proposes a novel approach to smishing detection that combines the power of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Text classification for identifying phishing messages has been approached through various methods, none of which can be definitively deemed right or wrong. Over time, discernible trends have surfaced, influenced by the perspectives of notable researchers, funding opportunities, and the evolution of available computer hardware. While deep learning and unsupervised methods have shown promise for text classification tasks like phishing detection, SVMs remain a solid baseline choice. SVMs are simple to train and interpret, tend to generalize well even with limited data, and have been successfully applied to phishing detection in past research. Additionally, deep neural networks typically require substantial data and compute resources to train effectively. Given the project budget and dataset constraints, not to mention the socioeconomic statuses of the Filipino people, an SVM strikes the right balance between classification performance and feasibility to implement. As the project matures, exploring more complex models may become viable. For now, focusing on a standard, proven technique allows faster progress toward a minimally viable phishing detector.

### Statement of the Problem
Smishing has become an escalating cybersecurity threat facing the Philippines. As the country with the highest SMS volume globally, it offers an ideal landscape for fraudsters carrying out smishing campaigns through text messages. These attacks trick mobile users into inputting private data on phony websites, enabling identity theft and financial fraud.

According to statistics from the Philippine National Police Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP ACG), smishing incidents more than doubled starting 2020, likely driven by perpetrators taking advantage of citizens' financial vulnerabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the implementation of SIM card registration laws, smishing continues intensifying, with the PNP ACG citing inability to track dynamic IP addresses as a key limitation in apprehending attackers.

While traditional anti-spam filters employed keyword matching and blacklists offer a baseline defense, they struggle to keep pace with the evolving tactics of smishers. These increasingly sophisticated scams necessitate more intelligent solutions. Worse, default messaging applications offered by Android and Apple often lack robust filtering mechanisms, leaving users vulnerable to smishing attempts.

Our study aims to address this problem by leveraging the capabilities of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to design and evaluate a comprehensive smishing detection model.

Specifically, our research project aims to answer the following research questions:

1. To what extent can Support Vector Machines (SVMs) effectively detect smishing messages compared to Logistic Regression?

2. What are the key linguistic and structural features that distinguish smishing messages from legitimate messages?

3. How does the performance of SVMs vary based on different feature sets extracted from smishing messages?

### Research Gap

There has been an increase in smishing messages being received by Filipinos during and after the pandemic. Recent studies have focused on email phishing, which is also on the rise lately, but little to no focus on smishing, a new form of phishing that is done via SMS. The core problem this research addresses is the inadequacy of existing mechanisms to combat smishing in the Philippines. Despite the country's vulnerability to smishing attacks, there is a lack of focused strategies and tools to mitigate this cybersecurity threat effectively. While the smishing crisis is evident, the research gap lies in the absence of a comprehensive understanding of local smishing attacks, tactics employed by attackers, and user vulnerabilities in the Philippines. This research seeks to fill this gap by providing context-specific insights that can inform the development of effective countermeasures.

There is little to no software solutions that are widely used by the Filipinos to mitigate these types of attacks. Even if Telcos do their own part (such as Smart blocking 342 million smishing attempts from the past year), it is still not enough as cases of spam and messaging scams are still rising. Incorporating our model as a context-aware filter in a messaging application powered with data analytics will help prevent future spams from being received by Filipinos. By leveraging Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Large Language Models (LLMs), the study seeks to develop advanced detection techniques that can significantly enhance the country's ability to combat smishing effectively.

Finally, the advent of large language models makes it easy to generate synthetic text. We can leverage this to generate synthetic smishing and legitimate text classes that fits in the Philippine context to augment the dataset and improve the accuracy of the model. This is a novel approach to the problem of smishing detection, and we believe that it will yield promising results.

### Significance of the Study
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it will give the following national significance particularly to the following:

* Security Professionals - In essence, cybersecurity experts and    analysts in the professional field would be deeply concerned about enhancing defenses against phishing and other scheming attacks that concern SMS transactions. They would be interested in understanding the efficacy of SVMs and similar machine learning techniques in detecting and preventing these threats. These professionals are responsible for monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security in- accidents. They focus on identifying potential vulnerabilities and threats, including smishing attacks, and finding effective ways to mitigate these risks.

* Telecommunication Companies - Telecommunication Companies such as Globe, TNT, etc. as companies value protecting their customers against phishing and attacks that directly harm their users, especially as SMS is one of the most important parts of their business model to earn revenue. Telecommunication companies might be interested in looking into potential vulnerabilities and exploits to address them, and to alleviate the rampant problem of smishing attacks.

* Government, Private, and Public Sectors - Both businesses and individual consumers are affected by smishing attacks. Businesses might be interested in adopting or implementing such technologies to protect their data and communications. Consumers would benefit from a more secure messaging environment to avoid falling victim to phishing attempts. Agencies responsible for regulating telecommunications and ensuring data privacy might take an interest in the development of more secure messaging environments. This could involve assessing the effectiveness of technologies like SVMs in combating smishing and implementing regulations or standards for messaging security.In a national scale, they are responsible for mitigating the risk of consumers directly clicking on SMS messages and links that looks suspicious in the first place. Business consumers would like to have extensive data either by datasets or through research, to find a way to protect their customers' user data.

* Research and Academic Institutions - People in the field of academia could find the research useful and interesting. Universities in international and research institutes will often conduct numerous studies aimed at understanding and countering threats in the cybersecurity world. Research on SVMs for smishing detection contributes to the knowledge base within academia which will lead to more publications about the topic in general. Academics and researchers in the field of cybersecurity, machine learning, and data analytics would be interested in studying the effectiveness of SVMs and exploring further advancements in using machine learning for smishing detection.

By conducting the research project, we effectively address and showcase solutions to the following sustainable development goals:

1. Goal 4: Quality Education - We believe that everyone that uses the internet, and its services, must be well-aware and be wary of spam and phishing messages to be able to identify them. Enhancing awareness among consumers is critical so that recognizing malicious messages and responding appropriately to them will not be such a challenge. By promoting quality education related to online safety, individuals can better protect themselves against cyber threats, contributing to SDG 4.

2. Goal 9:  Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure - The model contributes to the development of modern technologies and innovations in the field of cybersecurity. It also contributes to the development of infrastructure for cybersecurity, particularly in the Philippines. As there is no current noticeable system in place for these attacks, this could also fall under the in- novation side of the SDG as the model can be help key stakeholders to improve cybersecurity towards smishing. This in turn could help industries protect their businesses by using SVMs to detect potential threats.

3. Goal 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions - The model contributes to the development of stronger institutions by improving the security of messaging environments. This helps protect the privacy of individuals and organizations and prevents them from falling victim to phishing attacks. It encourages people to safeguard one another against cybercrime that may disrupt peace and social order. Efforts to improve cybersecurity, like using SVMs to detect smishing, support many key goals of SDG 16 by making digital spaces safer and more secure for everyone as it promotes accountability and transparency.

Finally, the research project also aims to address one of the key goals of National Innovation Agenda and Strategy Document. With the implementation of countermeasures against smishing attacks, especially since we live in the Philippines, we are effectively addressing the goals of NIASD's (National Innovation Agenda and Strategy Document) innovation policy, with our general objective of conducting education. Reviewing key performance indicators and including the possibility of attacks in unexpected ways such as smishing can help industries identify the root cause of the attacks and find a way to diminish these problems.
 
The project will also address NIASD's Innovation Infrastructure policy, with the general objective to design, establish, and upgrade physical and digital R\&D technology and innovation infrastructure and standards. This is to support industries with the model and to hopefully use our model for them as a way of inspiration to implement it in their cybersecurity system as one of the tools that will help industries combat smishing.
 
Finally, this project aims to address the third pillar of The National Innovation Agenda Framework namely Collaborative and Reliable Institutions policy of NIASD, specifically the security and defense. By proposing a model to Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) that can detect smishing messages with high accuracy, we can help the government and other institutions to protect their data and communications from phishing attacks.

### Objectives

The main objective of the research project is to utilize and assess the effectiveness the support vector machine in classifying smishing messages with high accuracy with the support of large language models in dataset generation. Specifically, it aims to:

1. To extract and identify the most effective features for smishing detection.
2. To develop a supervised learning model in the form of Support Vector Machines.
3. To evaluate the effectiveness of support vector machine compared to logistic regression in terms of its key metrics.
4. To leverage large language models in the generation of synthetic smishing and legitimate text classes to the dataset to improve the accuracy of the model.

### Scope and Limitations

The research project will focus on the development and evaluation of a supervised learning model from a collated dataset from the datasets of Almeida et al., Bwandowando, and large language models like ChatGPT. The output should be a working model of a support vector machine and a new collated and labeled dataset from the combination of the following:

* Synthetic Benign Filipino SMS Text Dataset by Large Language Models (GPT 3.5, Llama, Mistral)
* SMS Phishing (Philippines) Dataset from Bwandowando (Kaggle)
* Authentic Dataset of Benign English Texts from Mishra and Soni (2022)

The project only uses support vector machine and logistic regression models in its development and evaluation. As well, the project is constrained to the Philippine context. The model's performance in detecting smishing attacks in other regions or countries might vary due to language and cultural differences. Further, smishing attacks are constantly evolving, and new techniques may emerge during or after the completion of this study. The model's efficacy could be affected by novel attack strategies that it may not be equipped to detect. Finally, the performance and generalization capabilities of the developed model might be influenced by the quality and diversity of the training data. The model's effectiveness could be limited if it fails to generalize well to unseen or diverse smishing attacks. With the incorporation of novel large language models in synthetic generation of the training dataset, the performance of the model might be significantly affected.

### Smishing Detection
A study by Mishra and Soni (2021) presents DSmishSMS, a system designed to detect smishing SMS. Smishing poses unique challenges due to the limited information available in SMS, often abbreviated and symbolic, making detection difficult. The system addresses these challenges by evaluating the legitimacy of URLs in messages and extracting efficient features from text content. It consists of two phases: Domain Checking Phase and SMS Classification Phase. The former scrutinizes URL authenticity, while the latter examines text content and extracts features for classification using the Backpropagation Algorithm. The system was evaluated using SMS datasets, achieving an accuracy of 97.93%, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting smishing messages. This research contributes to the field of smishing detection by proposing a system that leverages URL legitimacy evaluation and efficient feature extraction from abbreviated and symbolic text content. The high accuracy achieved highlights the potential of the system in protecting smartphone users from smishing attacks.

Another study by Mambina et al. (2022) proposed a machine-learning based model to classify Swahili Smishing text messages targeting mobile money users. Their model achieved an accuracy score of 99.86% using a hybrid approach of Extratree classifier feature selection and Random Forest with TFIDF vectorization. The study highlighted the challenges of detecting Smishing attacks due to the differences in information available and attack strategy compared to phishing. The authors emphasized the need for models targeting low-resource languages like Swahili, as most existing techniques focus on high-resource languages. The study's findings contribute to the body of knowledge on Smishing detection and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working on mobile money security in Sub-Saharan Africa. The proposed model demonstrates promising performance in classifying Swahili Smishing attacks and can potentially be adapted to other low-resource languages. The study also underscores the importance of developing context-specific models that consider the unique characteristics of each language and region. Further research could explore the use of natural language processing techniques to improve the interpretability and explainability of the model's predictions, as well as investigate the transferability of the model to other domains or languages.

A study by Noah et al. (2022) aimed to combat the rising threat of phishing by creating an automated tool for phishing detection called PhisherCop. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, PhisherCop effectively identifies phishing attempts in both emails and text messages. To achieve this, the researchers employed eight machine learning classifiers, including Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), which outperformed others in spam email and SMS detection accuracy with an average of 96%. Noah et al. (2022) emphasize the importance of NLP in distinguishing between legitimate and malicious content, particularly in phishing scenarios. They highlight the rigorous data collection and pre-processing steps, including stop word removal, tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization, which enhance the performance of machine learning models. Furthermore, they emphasize the significance of PhisherCop as a web-based tool that can predict the validity of emails and SMS messages based on the accuracy score obtained from the best-performing machine learning models. This user-friendly tool represents a valuable resource for organizations and individuals seeking to protect themselves from phishing attacks.

A study by Ramesh et al. (2023) investigated phishing detection using the Random Forest algorithm. They emphasized the prevalence of phishing attacks and the need for reliable detection systems. The authors highlighted the effectiveness of machine learning techniques, particularly the Random Forest algorithm, in identifying phishing websites. Their proposed model achieved an accuracy of 97.14% with a low false positive rate, outperforming the Fully Convolutional Neural Network. The study also indicated that the detection performance improved with the volume of training data. The authors acknowledged the limitations of their research, such as the use of a specific dataset and the potential for phishing techniques to evolve. They suggested future research directions, including the implementation of hybrid technologies combining machine learning and blacklist methods for enhanced phishing detection accuracy. The study contributes to the body of knowledge on phishing detection and provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners working in this domain.
